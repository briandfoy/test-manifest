* Test::Manifest is now more tolerant of sloppiness.  It strips leading
and trailing whitespace as it reads lines from test_manifest, and it
skips comment lines.  
* If you already have Test::Manifest, you don't need to rush to get this
new version unless you have a problem with whitespace issues.

	* some minor tweaks for warnings, clarity
	* docs show way to make Test::Manifest optional (should have thought 
	of it sooner)

        * Made tests run clean under warnings.
	* Closed a file that failed when trying to delete it under
	  Windows.  (Thanks Mike O'Regan)
	* Added POD tests.

0.91 - Wed Dec 11 00:48:55 2002
	* require ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.x so the right run_tests is 
	available
